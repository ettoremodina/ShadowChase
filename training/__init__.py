"""
Training package for Shadow Chase advanced AI agents.

This package contains infrastructure for training sophisticated agents using
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Deep Q-Learning approaches.

Package structure:
- base_trainer: Abstract base class for all training algorithms
- feature_extractor: Game state to feature vector conversion
- utils/: Training utilities, environment, and evaluation tools
- mcts/: Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation (future)
- deep_q/: Deep Q-Learning implementation (future)
- configs/: Configuration files for different algorithms
