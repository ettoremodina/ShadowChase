# Simple Play - Terminal Scotland Yard

A clean, terminal-based implementation of Scotland Yard without GUI dependencies.

## Quick Start

### Interactive Single Game
```bash
cd ScotlandYardRL
python simple_play/simple_game.py
```

### Batch Mode (Automated Games)
```bash
# Play 10 AI vs AI games
python simple_play/simple_game.py --batch 10

# Play 50 games on full map with 3 detectives
python simple_play/simple_game.py --batch 50 --map-size full --detectives 3
```

### Quick Batch CLI
```bash
# Quick test batch (10 games)
python simple_play/batch_cli.py quick

# Full map testing (5 games)
python simple_play/batch_cli.py full

# Compare detective counts (20 games each for 2,3,4 detectives)
python simple_play/batch_cli.py compare
```

## Features

### Game Modes
- **Human vs Human**: Control both detectives and Mr. X
- **Human Detectives vs AI Mr. X**: Play as detectives against AI
- **AI Detectives vs Human Mr. X**: Play as Mr. X against AI detectives
- **AI vs AI**: Watch the AI play against itself (or batch mode)

### Map Options
- **Test Map**: 10 nodes, good for learning and fast testing
- **Full Map**: 199 nodes, complete Scotland Yard experience

### Batch Execution
- Play multiple games automatically with AI vs AI
- All games are saved automatically
- Detailed statistics and performance metrics
- Perfect for data collection and algorithm testing

### Display Verbosity Levels
1. **Basic**: Just positions and current turn (perfect for batch mode)
2. **Standard**: + Available moves and ticket counts
3. **Detailed**: + Move history and transport details
4. **Debug**: + All internal game state information

## Command Line Arguments

```bash
python simple_play/simple_game.py [options]

Options:
  --batch N                        Play N games automatically (AI vs AI)
  --map-size {test,full,extracted} Map size (default: test)
  --detectives {1,2,3,4}           Number of detectives (default: 2)
  --max-turns N                    Maximum turns per game (default: 24)
  --verbosity {1,2,3,4}            Output verbosity level (default: 2)
```

### Map Options
- **test**: 10-node test map for learning and quick testing
- **full**: Complete 199-node Scotland Yard board (CSV-based)
- **extracted**: Your custom extracted board from `board_progress.json`

### Using the Extracted Board
1. First extract your board using the board creator:
   ```bash
   # Extract nodes and edges from your board image
   python createBoard.py --phase nodes --image board.jpeg
   python createBoard.py --phase taxi --image board.jpeg  
   python createBoard.py --phase bus --image board.jpeg
   python createBoard.py --phase underground --image board.jpeg
   python createBoard.py --phase ferry --image board.jpeg
   ```

2. Then use it in games:
   ```bash
   # Interactive game with extracted board
   python simple_play/simple_game.py --map-size extracted
   
   # Batch testing with extracted board
   python simple_play/simple_game.py --batch 10 --map-size extracted --detectives 3
   ```

3. Visualize your extracted board:
   ```bash
   python visualize_board.py
   ```

## Integration

The simple play system integrates with the existing Scotland Yard codebase:

- Uses `cops_and_robbers.core.game.ScotlandYardGame` for game logic
- Uses `cops_and_robbers.examples.example_games` for game creation
- Compatible with existing AI solvers (uses random moves for now)

## Customization

### Adding New Display Formats
Extend the `GameDisplay` class in `display_utils.py` to add new formatting options.

### Adding New AI Strategies
Modify the `make_ai_move` method in `GameController` to use more sophisticated AI algorithms.

### Adding New Game Modes
Add new play modes in `game_logic.py` by extending the `get_game_mode` function.

**Note**: This is a simplified interface focused on clean terminal gameplay. For full graphical visualization, use the existing GUI system in `cops_and_robbers.ui.game_visualizer`.
