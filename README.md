## üé≤ How Shadow Chase Works

Shadow Chase is an asymmetric pursuit-evasion game with imperfect information, inspired by Shadow Chase:

- **MrX (1 player)**: The fugitive who moves secretly around the city using taxi, bus, underground, and black tickets. MrX becomes visible only on certain turns and has special abilities like double moves.

- **Detectives (5 players)**: Work together to capture the MrX by landing on their position. They have limited transport tickets and their movements are always visible.

- **Victory Conditions**:
  - **Detectives win**: If any agent lands on MrX's position
  - **MrX wins**: If they evade capture for 24 turns or if Detectives run out of moves

- **Transport Network**: Players move through the city using three transport types:
  - üöï **Taxi**: Available everywhere, limited tickets
  - üöå **Bus**: Faster routes, fewer connections
  - üöá **Underground**: Fastest but most limited network


## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- 8GB+ RAM (recommended for DQN training)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster DQN training)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ettoremodina/ShadowChase.git
cd ShadowChase
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Three Main Ways to Use This Project

#### 1. üéÆ Interactive Play (Graphical Interface)
Play Shadow Chase with a visual interface - control Detectives manually or watch AI agents play:
```bash
python main.py
```
- Choose between human and AI players
- Watch agent strategies in action
- Great for understanding game dynamics

#### 2. üß™ Agent Testing & Comparison
Systematically test different agent combinations and analyze their performance:
```bash
python test_agents.py
```
- Runs all agent combinations automatically
- Generates detailed performance analysis
- Perfect for benchmarking and research

#### 3. ü§ñ Train New DQN Agents
Train your own Deep Q-Learning agents:
```bash
python train_dqn.py --role MrX --episodes 10000
python train_dqn.py --role detectives --episodes 10000
```
- Train either MrX or agent teams
- Supports CPU and GPU training
- Saves models for later use

- **[training/configs/](training/configs/)**: Training configuration files
- **[data/](data/)**: Board data and game configurations
- **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)**: Project dependencies

## ü§ñ Available Agent Types

### Basic Agents
- **Random Agent**: Makes random valid moves (baseline)
- **Heuristic Agent**: Uses distance-based strategies
  - MrX: Maximizes distance from closest agent
  - Detectives: Minimize distance to MrX's last known position

### Advanced AI Agents
- **MCTS Agent**: Monte Carlo Tree Search with random simulations
- **Optimized MCTS**: Enhanced with caching for better performance  
- **Epsilon-Greedy MCTS**: MCTS with heuristic-guided simulations
- **DQN Agent**: Deep Q-Learning neural networks

### Performance Notes
- **Cache system works well for MCTS** agents, providing significant speedup
- **Game method caching** is less effective (retrieval cost > recalculation cost)
- **DQN training** benefits from GPU acceleration but runs fine on CPU
- **Memory requirements**: 8GB+ RAM recommended for large training sessions
- **Training time**: DQN training can take several hours for 10,000+ episodes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Training Configuration Files

The project includes several configuration files to customize training and game parameters:

- **[DQN Configuration](training/configs/dqn_config.json)**: Deep Q-Learning network architecture, training parameters, and hyperparameters
- **[MCTS Configuration](training/configs/mcts_config.json)**: Monte Carlo Tree Search parameters and optimization settings
- **[Board Metadata](data/board_metadata.json)**: Game board configuration and transport network settings
- **[Transport Colors](data/transport_colors.json)**: Visualization colors for different transport types

### Training Configuration
Edit `training/configs/dqn_config.json` to adjust:
- Network architecture (hidden layers, dropout)
- Training parameters (learning rate, epsilon decay)
- Experience replay settings

### Cache Settings
The caching system can be configured in your scripts:
```python
from ShadowChase.services.cache_system import *

enable_cache()
enable_namespace_cache(CacheNamespace.MCTS_NODES)      # Good for MCTS
disable_namespace_cache(CacheNamespace.GAME_METHODS)   # Not helpful
```

### Game Configuration
You can customize game parameters in several ways:
- **Map size**: Choose between test (10 nodes), full (199 nodes), or extracted board
- **Number of detectives**: Typically 2-5 detectives
- **Agent types**: Select from Random, Heuristic, MCTS, or DQN agents
- **Verbosity levels**: Control output detail in terminal mode

## ÔøΩ Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues

#### Installation Problems
- **CUDA Issues**: DQN training works fine on CPU if GPU is unavailable
- **Missing Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure all packages are installed
- **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.8+

#### Performance Issues
- **Slow MCTS**: Enable caching with `enable_namespace_cache(CacheNamespace.MCTS_NODES)`
- **Memory Usage**: Large replay buffers in DQN training may require 8GB+ RAM
- **Training Speed**: Use `--episodes` parameter to control training length

#### Gameplay Issues
- **Invalid Moves**: Check transport type availability and ticket counts
- **Game Not Starting**: Ensure starting positions don't overlap
- **Save/Load Errors**: Check that `saved_games/` directory exists and is writable

## üöß Future Development & Improvements

### High Priority Improvements Needed
- **üé® User Interface Overhaul**: The current GUI needs significant improvement for better usability
- **ü§ù Adversarial Training**: Implement adversarial learning to train Deep Learning based agents
